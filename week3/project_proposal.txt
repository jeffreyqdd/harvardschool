I will be creating a board game based off of Monopoly.

In a nutshell, a player wins by making others go bankrupt. The game will support up to 4 players. Each player's stats will be represented using a game struct. Each square on the board will be an array of structs. Say arr[5] will yield the 6th square's name type, ownership, rent cost, etc. I plan to add chance cards, also represented by structs, that will also have their own properties. I plan to devise a standard format to represent/pass the data to streamline function-to-function communication. As for the file I/O, I could log game events.

Game flow will be automated. The program will prompt the user to make decisions if necessary and inform the user about any changes made. Furthermore, if time allows, I will add cpu-controlled characters to play in place of human-counterparts. The cpu controlled characters will not run off of artificial networks (I'm not sure I can pull that off), but instead off of simple logic based if-else statements.

The game will run off a simple console output. Illustrations and game graphics will entirely consist of text-based art.
