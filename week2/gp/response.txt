1. What feature(s) would you liked to have added to your game if you had an extra week to get it
completed?


If I had another week to add on to the game I would add more functionality to it. First of all, I would add better graphics in the output stream. This might include having multiple .txt files each containing a different image made out of characters to display. Furthermore, I would add more customizability to the game such as a difficulty setting.
 


2. What was the most challenging part of this weekâ€™s assignment (you can reference anything from the
problem set or the game project)

In general the most challenging part of this week's assignment was learning how to write neat and efficient code. While viewing the Joe's hotdog stand walkthrough on Wednesday, I realized that there were many bad practices that I was doing. Some of which include not storing the cost of the items in a const double. So in this week's projects, I was actively trying to think of better, more efficient ways to write a certain lines of code. I still think there is a lot of room for improvement.
