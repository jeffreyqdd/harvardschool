1. What was the most useful skill you gained this week?

For me, the most useful skill I picked up this week was how to use getline(cin,dummy); to clear cin. Before I didn't know all the differences between cin>>, getline(), and get(), but now I can distinguish between each one and fix the problems that may arise when using cin and get().


2. What was the most interesting "fact" you learned this week?

Before I didn't know that precedence and associativity existed in C++. I always assumed that for example: x = y = z = 1; worked for some random reason. Now I have fuller confidence on where to put the parentheses when I code.
